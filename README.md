# TemplateEngine.Backend

This is a complementing library for [TemplateEngine](https://github.com/AgronKabashi/TemplateEngine). 
It provides the model and data needed for using and storing templates on the server side.

## How do I use this?

This library is meant to be used as a building block for any type application where you have
objects in a scene that present data or interact with the user. Examples of this would be:

* Content Management Systems
* Ad-design
* Design Mockup
* Single Page Applications
